# YouRemember - by Austin Lidey
A web application that utilizes Google/Youtube-Data API that's designed to curate the details of your favorite videos from a given playlist using Flask/Python. 

*This application works with any privacy setting for a playlist; public, unlisted, and even private playlists.* 

# Reason for Implementation
For me personally, it is always irritating when a video from one of my playlists would be made unavailable. Whether it was because the video was privated, deleted, or perhaps even made unavailable due to region restrictions or copyright claims. When this occurs, YouTube does not preserve the name or even the original thumbnail of that video for you to even attempt to find it elsewhere.

Hence, the reason why I created this solution. Never again will I fail to remember what song/video I saved to one of my many playlists that was obfuscated due to YouTube's content management system.
